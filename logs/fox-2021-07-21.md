## Dungeon - Atal'Dazar

Atal'Dazar is another low-level dungeon, available to players from level 10 onwards. You might think that this means it would be easy, but this dungeon, like all of the dungeons that came out with the Battle for Azeroth expansion, was designed for level 110+ characters. This isn't like The Deadmines, a classic WoW dungeon designed to gently ease players into their first dungeon experience, but rather a complete high-level dungeon that has some real challenges to it.

> For millennia, the Zandalari kings were laid to rest within the tombs of Atal'Dazar, secluded high atop the mountain Mugamba. These pyramids grew more elaborate with each passing ruler, as new rooms were constructed to house the deceased's vast wealth. Now, these once pristine halls have been corrupted by the Prophet Zul and his trusted lieutenant, Yazma, who seek to twist the power of these ancient kings for their own dark machinations.

Players were:
- Me: level 36 Shaman (healer)
- Alex: level 27 Demon Hunter tank
- Lynn: level 38 Druid DPS
- Marta: level 18 Druid DPS
- Michal: level 29 Hunter DPS

This was the first time that we'd been trying a dungeon as an all-guild team, with no outsiders. This was good as it meant that we could take things at our own pace, and learn skills that other (more experienced) players would take for granted.

Moving through various groups of mobs to the first boss was pretty straightforward, even when Alex made a mistake and ended up jumping into a second group of mobs we pulled through OK. The first boss Priestess Alun'za was relatively straightforward. An explanation of how the encounter worked was suficient to pull through in one go, and we made our way downstairs to the T-Rex boss Rezan. 

Rezan is often problematic because of two encounter mechanics: [Terrifying Visage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255371/terrifying-visage), which causes players to run in fear for 6 seconds, and [Pursuit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257407/pursuit), which causes a single (non-tank) member of the party to be chased after and eaten (this is often, unsurprisingly, fatal). Any player that runs over a pile of [Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) (which are all over the place) also spawns an add (a Reanimated Raptor skeleton) which DPS should focus fire down before it causes problems.

There was some great coordinateion and teamwork displayed, and despite some hairy moments, we 1-shotted the boss (i.e. defeated the encounter without wiping and retrying).
