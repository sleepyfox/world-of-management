# Easy guide to gearing for raiding

## Item Level of Dungeon Loot

The item level of loot has been increased by +26 in Patch 9.2's Season 3.

    Normal (level 60) dungeons will reward Item Level 210 gear
    Heroic dungeons will reward Item Level 223 gear 
    Mythic0 dungeons will reward Item Level 236 gear 
    Tazavesh (heroic) 223
    Tazavesh (mythic0) 236
    Zereth Mortis anima vendor loot 226
    Zereth Mortis rares 236
    Sandworn relic vendor 246
    Sepulcher of the first ones LFR 239/246 (last 3 bosses)
    Sepulcher of the first ones Normal 252/259

This makes gearing for raiding much easier, as:

* Normal level 60 dungeons require ilvl 144?
* Heroic dungeons require ilvl 170?
* LFR Sepulcher of the First Ones requires ilvl 220.

Normal, Heroic and Mythic0 dungeons can be run as many times as you like. Raids and Mythic+ dungeons can only drop gear once per boss per week. 

The good news is, this actually makes things pretty simple. Get to Zereth Mortis, buy loot with anima, pick up quest rewards and drops from rares and in no time you'll be ilvl 220+, which is enough to get you into the raid. Job done.
