## Practicalities

WoW is free till level 20. Try it out. Create yourself a [Battle.net](https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-gb) account,go to 'World of Warcraft Burning Crusade (TBC) Classic' under games and download the client for free.

Server: EU/Pyrewood Village - Alliance faction

## The plan

We plan to level to level cap together mostly in pairs or small groups, and do dungeons (5-player cooperative activities) in groups of five. This will prepare us for the primary objective of raiding in the upcoming expansion Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK), with 10 person raids. This requires good cooperation and communication skills, and an ability to retrospect on performance and improve continuously - a common challenge for business teams.

## Encounters

Raid challenges in the game are called 'encounters', and in WoW consist of one or more very difficult to defeat monsters ('bosses'), with or without the additional complication of easier to defeat accomplices ('trash mobs' in the parlance of the game).

In addition the encounter will have certain 'mechanics', things that are going on that will require the team to take certain actions, perhaps the boss is a dragon, and it will breath fire - making all players in front of the dragon need to run away or otherwise protect themselves, perhaps by hiding behind a rock or tower. Sometimes the dragon may swing their tail, sending hapless players that are directly behind them into the air and far away. Sometimes the dragon may cause eggs to hatch ('whelps') that will need to be deal with before they eat the players.

Generally there will be fire, and standing in it will cause the death (temporary) of your player. If too many players in the team die, then the entire team will die, this is called 'a wipe', and the team will need to respawn, regroup, and start again.

In general, there are things that must be done, coordinated, communicated, and the players need to find a way of working well as a team to defeat the challenge.

## Roles

In much the same way that we have roles at work in a team, sales, marketing, finance, HR, there are also roles in a WoW team:

* Tank
* DPS, melee
* DPS, ranged
* Healer

Tanks are there to keep the focus of the boss, and mitrigate the bosses damage with their tough armour and shields.
DPS (Damage Per Second) are there to deal damage to the boss, which will wear the boss down till it is eventually defeated. Melee DPS specialise in swords, spears and other hand-to-hand weapons. Ranged DPS specialise in bows, crossbows and spells.
Healers are there to keep the tank or tanks alive while the DPS do their work, with ranged healing spells. Occasionally they need to heal the DPS too, because there's always someone who stands in the fire!

## Classes

There are twelve playable classes (or jobs). Each class may have a number of roles that they can play, determined by their talent specialisation.

* druid (tank/melee DPS/ranged DPS/healer)
* death knight (tank/melee DPS)
* hunter (ranged DPS)
* mage (ranged DPS)
* paladin (tank/melee DPS/healer)
* priest (ranged DPS/healer)
* rogue (melee DPS)
* shaman (melee DPS/ranged DPS/healer)
* warlock (ranged DPS)
* warrior (tank/melee DPS)

Each 10-person raid needs 1 or 2 tanks, 2 or 3 healers and 5 to 7 DPS, usually a mix of melee and ranged. Typically one of the melee DPS will need to swap to being a tank for certain boss encounters (called an 'off-tank'), and one of the ranged DPS may need to swap to healing (called an 'off-healer') or visa versa. For this reason those classes which offer more flexibility of role are more useful to the team. Think 'T-shaped' team members.
